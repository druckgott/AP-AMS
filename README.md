_✨ A simple automatic color change system for Tuozhu ✨_
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
</div>

## Features
- A color change unit can work by itself! No host computer required!
- Low cost, a single color-changing unit costs only **50 yuan**
- Connect to homeassistant, data visualization, convenient monitoring of color changes and error correction (to be improved)
- Use esp8266 as MCU, Arduino development
- The main body of the color-changing unit is 3D printed except the motor and basic gears
- Use the servo to control the tightness of the gears, only tighten the gears when changing materials, and rely on the proximal extruder of Tuozhu for normal printing
- Low noise during normal printing

## Use
- You need to prepare:
- A heart that can calm down and toss
- Some of the [materials](https://makerworld.com/zh/models/463829#profileId-372457) mentioned in makerworld
- [Materials](https://oshwhub.com/applenana/ap-ams-control-panel-30) from LiChuang Open Source Plaza
- Here is [release](https://github.com/applenana/AP-AMS/releases/) (firmware)!
- (To be continued)

## Tips
- The project is basically completed. If you encounter any bugs, please send an issue or join QQ group 946045238
- The model and gcode have been uploaded to [makerworld](https://makerworld.com/zh/@applenana)
- PCB uploaded to [LiChuang Open Source Plaza](https://oshwhub.com/applenana/ap-ams-control-panel-30)
- The micropython version has been deprecated because the memory cannot support it running in esp8266. You can try to run it in esp32 (not recommended)

## Thanks
- The overall idea and some information of the whole project come from [YBA0312's YBA-AMS project](https://github.com/YBA0312/YBA-AMS-ESP)!
